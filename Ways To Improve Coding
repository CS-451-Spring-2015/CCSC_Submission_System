Enter file contents here1-Understand Syntax/Coding Standards
This includes:
Change file names to be formatted with the first letter of each word capitalized, no abbreviations of words,  and no spaces, hyphens, underscores or other sperators.  Ex: FirstSecondThird
All files listed need to be renamed to follow that format
 
2. There are some places on pages where semi-colons (;) seem randomly placed and not at the end of a line. These are part of “echo” functions and should be left alone.
3. Tabs/indentations need to be correct; only necessary ones made. (On all files)
4. Understand format/layout of pages as they appear on the site
5. Know which pages should be linked
6. Double check spelling each time a file name or part of code is changed.
7. Make sure each file name that’s changed is done so all instances to be the same.
8. Delete unused files
10. Make note of which lines you’ve changed in detail. Note the file, code line’s number, what the line read before, the indentations etc as well as the changes that were made in case something gets “broken.”
11. Make sure each open/close tag matches with same indentation so that making note of them when looking at the code is easier. This also applies to braces { }.
